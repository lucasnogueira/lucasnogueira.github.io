    <h1>Myself</h1>

    <div class="entry">
      <p>Hey! My name is Lucas and I work as a Ruby developer since 2011.</p>

      <p>In my first contact with programming I had 15 years old and was in a tech course for teenagers. Since then I never stopped.</p>

      <p>I graduated in Information Systems from Universidade de São Paulo, where during the course I had the chance to discover and study
      several other technologies and programming languages.</p>

      <p>But was almost by the end of the graduation journey that I met what would change the road for the next years:</p>

      <h3 id="more-information">A Little More</h3>

      <p>I was born in Santos, but I work and spent most of my time in São Paulo.</p>

      <p>What drives me is the learning. I love to learn the most I can from everything.</p>

      <p>At the present moment I am studying Italian (and planning the next new things I will learn).</p>

      <p>I believe strongly in the power of collaboration. You must set a goal for everything you do in life. With technology is no different.
      If you are not capable of using your knowledge to help the others, maybe you should not try at all.</p>

      <p>Keep things simple and do your best. But please do not forget to enjoy the road.</p>

      <br>
