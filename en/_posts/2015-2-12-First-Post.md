Hello! This is my first blog post. In this same place I will talk about programming, technology and other cool things
around this subject.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/one/first-blog-post-winning.jpg)

I used [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to create this blog for some reasons:

1. Practical and easy, allowing me a high level of customization.

2. GitHub Pages, meaning I no longer need to worry about hosting plus some good advantages.

3. "Commit" your own posts is cool :smiley:

4. A new challenge :computer:

The part I most like during the creation of the blog was building a bilingual structure for the whole blog. There are some
plugins that I believe that can handle the job, but that was not my intention. I found some blog posts that I used as a base.
In the end I created a structure like this:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/one/blog-structure.png)

The portuguese posts remained inside `_posts`. The different layout files are used to handle the differences between pages.
This way I can maintain all that is english inside the `EN` category.

This is the end for now. Soon enough I will bring more interesting posts (for real).

### Some links that will help you learn more about Jekyll and a bilingual blog process:

- [Basic tutorial about the subject.](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/using-jekyll--cms-20956)
- [The best post I found about bilingual Jekyll blog](http://kleinfreund.de/en/2014/08/jekyll-multilingual/). I used
a lot of concepts from this post, but I swear layout was not one :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
